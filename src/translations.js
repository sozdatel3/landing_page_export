    juliaIntro: "Dental care in the U.S. without insurance is extremely expensive, and many dental insurance plans come with long waiting periods and limited coverage for major procedures like root canals, crowns, and implants. Because of this, people often delay care—only to face bigger, more painful, and far more expensive problems later.",
    juliaPassion: "Several years ago, while looking for an immediate implant solution for myself, I discovered rare group-access PPO dental plans that saved me 50% without any waiting period. I got inspired, became a rep to sell these plans, and brought it to wide audiences. Over the past three years, these plans have helped 1,500+ people nationwide move forward with needed dental treatment, supported by trusted dentist referrals in NY, PA, FL, CA, and IL.",
    clientStats: `Recently, our trusted association partner, Elevate Wellness, updated its plan structure: MetLife now includes a 12-month waiting period for major services, and enrollment requires U.S. citizenship or permanent residency. (Delta Dental PPO remains unchanged.)<br><br>Due to those changes, unfortunately, there are no longer uniform solutions that fit everyone.<br><br>
<strong>🔹 How We Help Now</strong><br>
We’ve adapted by identifying alternative, association-based dental options that work in a similar way. Today, we offer plans from three different sources (including Elevate Wellness). Each option is designed for different needs, timing, and eligibility—and while we do our best, not every situation can be helped.<br><br>
<strong>🔹 How We Operate (Please Read)</strong><br>
We are not traditional dental brokers offering dozens of plans from various states and carriers. Our primary work is in life, disability, and long-term care insurance planning, and we approach dental coverage with the same care—focusing only on solutions that clients and dentist partners consistently find practical and effective. Clean, simple, comprehensive and affordable!<br><br>
Our main requirement is immediate or near-immediate access to major services, when available: root canals • crowns • implants. This site is designed to let you review options and enroll at your own pace, with minimal broker involvement. Registration is very click and easy with the links, and you receive immediate confirmations.<br><br>
👉 Before enrolling, we strongly recommend reviewing the plan with your dentist, or using the plan’s provider search link to find an in-network provider.<br>
⚠️ Important: As brokers, we can’t guarantee that a specific procedure will be covered or paid. Final coverage decisions are made by the insurance carrier. Please ask your dental office to contact the insurer directly to confirm benefits before treatment and insure billing is done correctly to avoid delays in benefit payments. All eligibility details and support contacts are available inside each plan link.<br><br>
💙 Our goal is to help you get the dental care you need efficiently—without long waits, unnecessary hassle, and while saving money.`,

Мне также нравится находить инновационные решения, которые закрывают критические пробелы и помогают реально экономить на жизненно важных услугах, таких как стоматологическая помощь.",
            clientStats: `Недавно наш проверенный партнёр-ассоциация Elevate Wellness обновил структуру планов: в MetLife появился <strong>12-месячный период ожидания</strong> для крупных услуг, а для регистрации теперь требуется <strong>гражданство США или статус постоянного резидента (Green Card)</strong>. (Delta Dental PPO без изменений.)<br><br>
Из-за этих изменений, к сожалению, больше нет универсального решения, которое подходило бы всем.<br><br>
<strong>🔹 Как мы помогаем сейчас</strong><br>
Мы адаптировались и нашли альтернативные, ассоциированные варианты стоматологического покрытия, которые работают похожим образом. Сегодня мы предлагаем планы из <strong>трёх разных источников</strong> (включая Elevate Wellness). Каждый вариант рассчитан на разные потребности, сроки и критерии участия — и, хотя мы стараемся, помочь можно не в каждой ситуации.<br><br>
<strong>🔹 Как мы работаем (пожалуйста, прочитайте)</strong><br>
Мы не классические стоматологические брокеры, предлагающие десятки планов по разным штатам и компаниям. Основная часть нашей работы — страховое планирование по жизни, инвалидности и долгосрочному уходу, и к стоматологическому покрытию мы подходим так же тщательно — выбираем только те решения, которые клиенты и партнёры-стоматологи считают действительно практичными и эффективными: простые, понятные, комплексные и доступные.<br><br>
Наш главный критерий — немедленный или почти немедленный доступ к крупным услугам, когда это возможно: лечение каналов • коронки • импланты. Этот сайт создан, чтобы вы могли спокойно сравнить варианты и зарегистрироваться в удобном темпе, с минимальным участием брокера. Регистрация максимально простая: по ссылкам, с мгновенными подтверждениями.<br><br>
👉 Перед регистрацией настоятельно рекомендуем обсудить план со своим стоматологом или воспользоваться ссылкой поиска провайдеров, чтобы найти врача в сети.<br>
⚠️ Важно: как брокеры мы не можем гарантировать, что конкретная процедура будет покрыта или оплачена. Окончательное решение принимает страховая компания. Попросите вашу клинику связаться со страховщиком для подтверждения льгот перед лечением и убедиться, что выставление счетов сделано корректно, чтобы избежать задержек в выплатах. Все детали по критериям участия и контакты поддержки находятся внутри каждой ссылки на план.<br><br>
💙 Наша цель — помочь вам получить необходимое стоматологическое лечение без долгих ожиданий, лишних сложностей и с экономией денег.`,

            <p>Мы приглашаем стоматологов, таких как вы, стать нашими партнерами в предложении двух захватывающих групповых планов PPO стоматологического страхования: MetLife PPO и Delta Dental PPO 1500. Эти планы не имеют периодов ожидания, исключений для отсутствующих зубов и покрывают серьезные процедуры, такие как имплантаты, коронки и лечение каналов — с первого дня.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>✅ Пациенты получают преимущества от более быстрых одобрений, меньших расходов из собственного кармана и большей мотивации следовать необходимому стоматологическому лечению.</li>
            <li>✅ Стоматологи получают преимущества от меньшего количества отмен, более быстрого оборота лечения и более счастливых, лояльных пациентов.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Давайте работать вместе, чтобы сделать качественную стоматологическую помощь более доступной и упорядоченной.</p>
            <p>📩 Свяжитесь с нами сегодня — мы с радостью отправим материалы планов, обучим вашу команду и даже направим пациентов, которые активно ищут провайдеров в сети в вашем районе.</p>

            clientStats: `Нещодавно наш надійний партнер-асоціація Elevate Wellness оновив структуру планів: MetLife тепер має <strong>12-місячний період очікування</strong> для послуг Major, а для реєстрації потрібне <strong>громадянство США або статус постійного резидента (Green Card)</strong>. (Delta Dental PPO без змін.)<br><br>
Через ці зміни, на жаль, більше немає універсального рішення, яке підходило б усім.<br><br>
<strong>🔹 Як ми допомагаємо зараз</strong><br>
Ми адаптувалися та знайшли альтернативні асоціаційні стоматологічні опції, що працюють подібним чином. Сьогодні ми пропонуємо плани з <strong>трьох різних джерел</strong> (включно з Elevate Wellness). Кожен варіант розрахований на різні потреби, строки та критерії — і хоча ми намагаємося, не кожну ситуацію можна допомогти.<br><br>
<strong>🔹 Як ми працюємо (будь ласка, прочитайте)</strong><br>
Ми не є традиційними стоматологічними брокерами, які пропонують десятки планів у різних штатах та компаніях. Наша основна робота — планування страхування життя, інвалідності та довгострокового догляду, і до стоматологічного покриття ми підходимо так само уважно — обираємо лише рішення, які клієнти та партнери-стоматологи вважають практичними та ефективними: прості, зрозумілі, комплексні й доступні.<br><br>
Наша головна вимога — негайний або майже негайний доступ до major-послуг, коли це можливо: лікування каналів • коронки • імпланти. Цей сайт створений, щоб ви могли переглянути опції та зареєструватися у своєму темпі, з мінімальною участю брокера. Реєстрація дуже проста за посиланнями, і ви отримуєте миттєві підтвердження.<br><br>
👉 Перед реєстрацією ми наполегливо радимо обговорити план з вашим стоматологом або скористатися посиланням пошуку провайдера, щоб знайти лікаря в мережі.<br>
⚠️ Важливо: як брокери ми не можемо гарантувати, що конкретна процедура буде покрита чи оплачена. Остаточне рішення приймає страхова компанія. Попросіть вашу клініку зв’язатися зі страховиком напряму, щоб підтвердити пільги перед лікуванням і переконатися, що рахунки виставляються правильно, щоб уникнути затримок у виплатах. Уся інформація про критерії участі та контакти підтримки є всередині кожного посилання на план.<br><br>
💙 Наша мета — допомогти вам отримати потрібну стоматологічну допомогу без довгих очікувань, зайвих складнощів та з економією коштів.`,

          <p>Ви шукаєте способи допомогти своїм пацієнтам швидше приступити до лікування — і з меншою фінансовою вагомістю?</p>
          <p>Ми запрошуємо стоматологів, таких як ви, співпрацювати з нами в пропозиції двох захоплюючих групових PPO стоматологічних планів: MetLife PPO та Delta Dental PPO 1500.

          <ul>
              <li>✅ Пацієнти отримують користь від швидших схвалень, нижчих витрат із власної кишені та більшої мотивації довести до кінця необхідну стоматологічну роботу.</li>
              <li>✅ Стоматологи отримують користь від меншої кількості скасувань, швидшого обороту лікування та щасливіших, більш лояльних пацієнтів.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Давайте працювати разом, щоб зробити якісну стоматологічну допомогу більш доступною та впорядкованою.</p>
          <p>📩 Зв'яжіться з нами сьогодні — ми з радістю надішлемо матеріали планів, навчимо вашу команду та навіть направимо пацієнтів, які активно шукають провайдерів у мережі у вашому районі.</p>

ჩვენ მოვერგეთ სიტუაციას და გამოვავლინეთ ალტერნატიული, ასოციაციაზე დაფუძნებული სტომატოლოგიური ვარიანტები, რომლებიც მსგავსი პრინციპით მუშაობს. დღეს ჩვენ გთავაზობთ გეგმებს <strong>სამ განსხვავებულ წყაროდან</strong> (მათ შორის Elevate Wellness). თითოეული ვარიანტი გათვლილია სხვადასხვა საჭიროებაზე, ვადებზე და კვალიფიკაციაზე — და მიუხედავად ჩვენი ძალისხმევის, ყველა შემთხვევის დახმარება ვერ ხერხდება.<br><br>
<strong>🔹 როგორ ვმუშაობთ (გთხოვთ წაიკითხოთ)</strong><br>
ჩვენ არ ვართ ტრადიციული სტომატოლოგიური ბროკერები, რომლებიც სხვადასხვა შტატისა და კომპანიის ათეულობით გეგმას გვთავაზობენ. ჩვენი ძირითადი საქმიანობაა სიცოცხლის, შრომისუუნარობის და გრძელვადიანი მოვლის დაზღვევის დაგეგმვა, და სტომატოლოგიურ დაფარვასაც იმავე სიფრთხილით ვუდგებით — ვირჩევთ მხოლოდ იმ გადაწყვეტილებებს, რომლებიც კლიენტებსა და პარტნიორ სტომატოლოგებს პრაქტიკულად და ეფექტურად მიაჩნიათ: მარტივი, გასაგები, სრულყოფილი და ხელმისაწვდომი.<br><br>

👉 ჩარიცხვამდე ძლიერ გირჩევთ, გეგმა განიხილოთ თქვენს სტომატოლოგთან ან გამოიყენოთ პროვაიდერის ძებნის ბმული ქსელში არსებული ექიმის დასადგენად.<br>
⚠️ მნიშვნელოვანი: როგორც ბროკერები, ვერ გარანტიას ვაძლევთ, რომ კონკრეტული პროცედურა დაფარული ან გადახდილი იქნება. საბოლოო გადაწყვეტილებას იღებს სადაზღვევო კომპანია. სთხოვეთ თქვენს კლინიკას დაუკავშირდეს მზღვეველს პირდაპირ, რათა მკურნალობამდე დაადასტუროს შეღავათები და სწორად შესრულდეს ბილინგი, რათა არ მოხდეს გადახდების დაგვიანება. ყველა კვალიფიკაციის დეტალი და მხარდაჭერის კონტაქტი მოცემულია თითოეული გეგმის ბმულში.<br><br>
💙 ჩვენი მიზანია დაგეხმაროთ საჭირო სტომატოლოგიური დახმარების მიღებაში ეფექტურად — ხანგრძლივი ლოდინის გარეშე, ზედმეტი უსიამოვნებების გარეშე და თანხის დაზოგვით.`,

  clientStats: `Yaqinda bizning ishonchli assotsiatsiya hamkorimiz Elevate Wellness reja tuzilmasini yangiladi: MetLife endi <strong>Major xizmatlar uchun 12 oylik kutish davrini</strong> qo‘llaydi va ro‘yxatdan o‘tish uchun <strong>AQSh fuqaroligi yoki doimiy rezidentlik (Green Card)</strong> talab qilinadi. (Delta Dental PPO o‘zgarmagan.)<br><br>
Ushbu o‘zgarishlar sabab, afsuski, hamma uchun bir xil mos keladigan yagona yechim endi yo‘q.<br><br>
<strong>🔹 Hozir qanday yordam beramiz</strong><br>
Biz moslashdik va shu kabi ishlaydigan alternativ, assotsiatsiya asosidagi stomatologik variantlarni aniqladik. Bugun biz <strong>uchta turli manbadan</strong> (jumladan Elevate Wellness) rejalarni taklif qilamiz. Har bir variant turli ehtiyojlar, vaqt va moslik mezonlari uchun mo‘ljallangan — va qo‘limizdan kelgancha harakat qilsak ham, hamma holatga yordam berishning iloji bo‘lmasligi mumkin.<br><br>
<strong>🔹 Qanday ishlaymiz (iltimos, o‘qing)</strong><br>
Biz turli shtatlar va sug‘urta kompaniyalaridan o‘nlab rejalarni taklif qiladigan an’anaviy dental brokerlar emasmiz. Bizning asosiy ishimiz — hayot, nogironlik va uzoq muddatli parvarish sug‘urtasini rejalashtirish; dental qamrovga ham xuddi shunday e’tibor bilan yondashamiz — mijozlar va hamkor stomatologlar amaliy va samarali deb biladigan yechimlargina: sodda, tushunarli, keng qamrovli va hamyonbop.<br><br>
Bizning asosiy talabimiz — mavjud bo‘lsa, major xizmatlarga darhol yoki deyarli darhol kirish: kanal davosi • krona • implant. Ushbu sayt sizga variantlarni ko‘rib chiqish va o‘zingizga qulay tezlikda ro‘yxatdan o‘tish imkonini beradi, broker aralashuvi minimal. Havolalar orqali ro‘yxatdan o‘tish juda oson va darhol tasdiq olasiz.<br><br>
👉 Ro‘yxatdan o‘tishdan oldin reja haqida stomatologingiz bilan muhokama qilishni yoki tarmoqdagi provayderni topish uchun rejaning provider qidiruv havolasidan foydalanishni qat’iy tavsiya qilamiz.<br>
⚠️ Muhim: broker sifatida biz aniq bir protsedura qoplanishini yoki to‘lanishini kafolatlay olmaymiz. Yakuniy qarorni sug‘urta kompaniyasi qabul qiladi. Davolanishdan oldin imtiyozlarni tasdiqlash va billing to‘g‘ri bajarilganini tekshirish uchun klinikangizdan sug‘urtachi bilan bevosita bog‘lanishini so‘rang — bu to‘lovlar kechikishini oldini oladi. Moslik tafsilotlari va yordam kontaktlari har bir reja havolasi ichida mavjud.<br><br>
💙 Maqsadimiz — sizga kerakli dental yordamni uzoq kutishlarsiz, ortiqcha ovora bo‘lmasdan va pul tejagan holda olishga yordam berish.`,

  juliaIntro: "Hola, soy Julia Barinova, una Asesora de Seguros y Corredora independiente con sede en la ciudad de Nueva York, con más de 20 años de experiencia en servicios financieros - desde consultoría de inversiones y marketing de fondos de cobertura hasta planificación personalizada de seguros.",
  juliaPassion: "Soy apasionada por ayudar a las personas a protegerse a sí mismas, a sus familias y negocios de riesgos financieros devastadores - ya sea que surjan de enfermedades graves, pérdida de ingresos, necesidades de cuidado a largo plazo, o la pérdida de un ser querido - educándolos y construyendo estrategias de seguros inteligentes y personalizadas. También me encanta descubrir soluciones innovadoras que llenan vacíos críticos y ahorran dinero real en servicios esenciales como el cuidado dental.",
  clientStats: `Recientemente, nuestro socio de confianza, la asociación Elevate Wellness, actualizó su estructura de planes: MetLife ahora incluye un <strong>período de espera de 12 meses</strong> para servicios Mayores, y la inscripción requiere <strong>ciudadanía estadounidense o residencia permanente</strong>. (Delta Dental PPO no cambia.)<br><br>
Debido a esos cambios, lamentablemente, ya no existen soluciones uniformes que funcionen para todos.<br><br>
<strong>🔹 Cómo ayudamos ahora</strong><br>
Nos adaptamos identificando opciones dentales basadas en asociaciones que funcionan de manera similar. Hoy ofrecemos planes de <strong>tres fuentes diferentes</strong> (incluida Elevate Wellness). Cada opción está diseñada para distintas necesidades, tiempos y requisitos de elegibilidad—y aunque hacemos lo mejor posible, no todas las situaciones se pueden ayudar.<br><br>
<strong>🔹 Cómo operamos (por favor lee)</strong><br>
No somos corredores dentales tradicionales que ofrecen docenas de planes de varios estados y compañías. Nuestro trabajo principal es la planificación de seguros de vida, discapacidad y cuidado a largo plazo, y abordamos la cobertura dental con el mismo cuidado—enfocándonos solo en soluciones que clientes y dentistas socios consideran prácticas y efectivas: limpias, simples, completas y asequibles.<br><br>
Nuestro requisito principal es acceso inmediato o casi inmediato a servicios Mayores cuando estén disponibles: endodoncias • coronas • implantes. Este sitio está diseñado para que revises opciones y te inscribas a tu propio ritmo, con mínima intervención del corredor. El registro es muy fácil con los enlaces y recibes confirmaciones inmediatas.<br><br>
👉 Antes de inscribirte, recomendamos revisar el plan con tu dentista o usar el enlace de búsqueda de proveedores para encontrar un proveedor dentro de la red.<br>
⚠️ Importante: como corredores, no podemos garantizar que un procedimiento específico sea cubierto o pagado. Las decisiones finales de cobertura las toma la aseguradora. Pide a tu consultorio dental que contacte a la aseguradora directamente para confirmar beneficios antes del tratamiento y asegurarse de que la facturación se haga correctamente para evitar demoras en los pagos. Todos los detalles de elegibilidad y contactos de soporte están dentro de cada enlace del plan.<br><br>
💙 Nuestro objetivo es ayudarte a obtener la atención dental que necesitas de forma eficiente—sin largas esperas, sin complicaciones innecesarias y ahorrando dinero.`,

  // How coverage works
  coverageWorksTitle: "💡 Cómo Funcionan los Porcentajes de Cobertura",
  coverageExplanation: [
      "📌 La cobertura del 100% (Preventiva), 80% (Básica), y 50% (Mayor) se calcula basada en la tarifa negociada dentro de la red para cada procedimiento dental.",
      "👩‍⚕️ Los dentistas dentro de la red deben seguir tarifas preestablecidas entre ellos y el asegurador - y tu parte se basa en esas tarifas reducidas.",
      "❗ ¿Vas fuera de la red? Puedes esperar facturas algo más altas y más gastos de tu bolsillo. La opción fuera de la red es genial tener si tu dentista favorito no está en la red. ¡Usualmente, aún ahorrarás bastante dinero comparado con pagar en efectivo!",
      "👉 Al elegir un nuevo dentista, trata de confirmar con tu dentista que están en la red con tu plan para evitar facturas sorpresa."
